Module 6 Challenge

All files labeled with a ".._hw" are files that I created for this challenge. I utilized the Xpert Learning Assistant tool on the bootcamp spot website for defining the linear regression line in the WeatherPy portion and again where "params=params" in the VacationPy porition.

WeatherPy discussions listed below:

Temperature vs Latitude discussion: The linear relationship between the max temperature and the latitude shows of both hemispheres have absolute r-values that are strong. The farther you are away from the equator of the earth, the colder it gets in either direction of it. 

Humidity vs Latitude discussion: I'm actually a little surprised that the southern hemisphere's humidity has a stronger rvalue than northern hemispher's humidity. Then again humidity is just the amount of water vapor is in the air. The data might have locations clustered closer towards desert areas or more inland away from water which could be why there's less corrolation between humiidty and the latitude points in the data set.

Cloudiness vs Latitude discussion: Cloudiness seems to be in the extremes and don't really correlate with how near or far you are from the equator; or at least with this dataset. Very low r values on both the north and south hemispheres.

Wind Speed vs Latitude discussion: I'm actually surprised there doesn't seem to be any correlation between windspeed and where you are closer or farther you are from the equator. Both norther and souther hemispheres have low r values and there seems to be more outliners than all the other previous linear regressions I've calculated.

VacationPy Notes:

Displaying the maps for this portion of the assignment was not working in my VS Code, but no errors display either. I was advised to open the jupyter notebook in a browser in order to be able to display these maps and to be able to make sure that the hover feature for the last prompt was working correctly.
